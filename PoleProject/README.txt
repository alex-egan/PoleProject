Project: Top of Pile Calculator

This program will take a list of coordinates and elevations and calculates the minimum reveal values
for the top of the solar panel piles.

Notes:
1. We are not quite sure why this is, but for some reason the excel files can only be read when they
are placed in the Debug folder of this project. So when trying to run this project with a new excel
file, please place the file in the Debug folder. We are working on a solution for this in the meantime.
